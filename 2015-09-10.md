## Can I Actually Use It? Testing Open Textbooks for Accessibility

Tara Robertson (CAPER-BC) and Kendra Levine (University of California at Berkeley)

- last year served 1200 students with print disability
- shift print to digital which is allowed by Canadian Copyright Act
- traditionally takes 3 weeks for students to get book
- cost of textbooks have gone up 816% in 30 years
- open education is a social justice issue
- goals of BC Open Textbook Project (http://bccampus.ca/open-textbook-project/)
    - increase access to higher ed by reducing costs
    - enable faculty more control over instructional resources
    - move the Open Educational Resources (OER) agenda forward
- yesterday (September 9, 2015) the 100th book was created
- using PressBooks (http://pressbooks.com/) open source plugin for WordPress - allows to publish to many file types
- project has saved students ~$600-800K
- did testing with 15 users of 5 textbooks in focus group - helped identify content that was not accessible (e.g. YouTube videos skipped by Jaws; Zoom Text made horizontal scrolling required for reading poetry)
- key concepts - universal design for learning; user personas
- best practices - organizing content; images; tables; weblinks; multimedia; formulas; font size; colour contrast
- they created a best practices book, now in French too
- will be doing further user testing
- takeaways
    - user testing is invaluable
    - include people with disabilities in user testing
    - learn more about universal design, and design things for access from the start

### Q and A

- Q: speak to the quality of the textbooks?
- A: incentivized profs to review the quality (i.e. paid $400 per review); allows prof to customize content around book instead of being beholden to publisher content and test banks
- Q: speak to need for further authoring tools that are accessible by default?
- A: in BC, are adapating PressBooks; math formulae are tricky, but there are some improvements by top three screen readers that read MathML (each has their own variant of MathML)


## DIALLED: Distributed Index of All(\*) Library Location and Event Data

Dan Scott (Laurentian University)

- has worked on schema.org integration in Evergreen, Koha, and VuFind
- Evergreen exposes linked data about the library 
- between 100-1000 libraries have exposed schema.org/Library
- "meta-institutional data" is a thing, but most of our ILSes and websites don't expose this data
- WorldCat doesn't have the data either
- a user that Googles "library hours" will trust it rather than the library's website -- important that library website exposes hours data correctly
- partnered with CWRC site (http://cwrc.ca/rsc-src/) to map libraries across Canada, but most of the data is manually entered because data can't be crawled
- Dan wrote an article in OJS on PERJ at UofGuelph (https://journal.lib.uoguelph.ca/index.php/perj/article/view/3328#.VfmrFM5Dkjg)
- http://dialled.ca/
- http://github.com/dbs/One-Pager/tree/schema.org
- incentives
    - cleaner data for personal agents (e.g. Siri)
    - inclusion in OpenStreetMap, wikidata, and the LOD cloud
    - more dynamic CWRC map
    - making dialled.ca a possibility

### Q and A

- Q: how to handle bilingualism?
- A: finally have access to website template for Laurentian library's homepage and will implement; Evergreen already has items in English and French 


## Hackfest Reports

- OWASP's WebGoat project (an intentionally insecure Java app) that has security-related learning exercises
- Review of room booking systems, which are universally bad, and then brainstorm on what it should look like
- Review of Sonic Pi (http://sonic-pi.net/) samples, part of the sonification hackfest


## The Impact of Linked Data in Digital Curation and Application to the Cataloguer's Workflow

Stacey Boileau (Ontario Colleges Library Service), Jenny Jing, Erin Tripp (Discovery Garden), Ian Bigelow (Georgian College), and Danielle Emon (Loyalist College)

### Jenny

- linked data allows publishing of data to user so they can repurpose it to their liking
- semantic web - promotes common data formats on the web
- four principles of linked data from Tim Berners-Lee (http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/LinkedData.html)
    - URIs for names of things
    - use HTTP
    - when someone looks up URIs, provide other info using standards (RDF, SPARQL)
    - use triples (i.e. links to other things)
- we (librarianship) put information in Information Technology 
- if data is like water:
    - MARC = ice (not flexible)
    - RDF/XML = liquid (more flexible)
    - Linked Data = cloud
- linked data has life-cycle 

### Erin

- use Fedora for storage and also for metadata for relationship information
- TU Delft repository example (http://colonialarchitecture.eu/)
    - every object is linked to other objects/information (e.g. geographic)
    - used Fedora 3 which doesn't have easy SPARQL endpoint, but in Fedora 4 would be able to use/show the graph a little better because can query SPARQL endpoints in real-time
    - tried to automate the generation of triples (created Delftdora module) - required additional indexing 
    - promoted re-use of objects and aided in discovery of objects

### Ian, Stacey and Danielle

- MARC is ancient but it has survived due to its strengths 
- OCLS is trying to implement linked data in cataloguing workflow
- also working on implementing MARC in modular way and using RDF
- Libhub example from Denver Public Library and Zepheira
- working with OCLS cataloguers on implementing linked data in MARC 
- AAP = authorized access points
- goal is to have better metadata, regardless of how linked data is implemented across libraries
- OCLS established in 2009 to provide resources for 24 Ontario colleges
- OCLS provides CUC (union catalogue)
- updated their workflow documentation to reflect the change to RDA from AACR2/MARC
- focus on relationship building opportunities at each stage of the workflow with generous use of authority data, for now
- goal is to have cataloguers shift the flow in their head so they are ready for the changes coming in the future i.e. this is a people issue, not just a cataloguing/technology issue


## Library of Cards

Mita Williams (University of Windsor)

- referenced 99% Invisible podcast about design (http://99percentinvisible.org/)
- Markus Krajewski - "Paper Machines" book - posits card catalogue happened very early (1780s? in Vienna)
- French revolutionaries 1781 had to catalogue what books they now owned and came up with a system of using playing cards
- Konrad Gessner - "The Bibliotheca Universalis" - first modern bibliographer
- "scholar's boxes" 
- Leibniz had an "excerpt cabinet" to store quotes and references of his work
- Scriviner (https://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener.php) - software to track virtual cards use in writing process
- Zotero - browser extension for tracking citations; uses COINS microformat 
- RIS2WEB - for publishing bibliography on the web; see labourstudies.ca for example
- Paper Machines - open-source extension for Zotero; does text analysis and visualization aimed at researchers in humanities and social sciences
- need to extend copy-paste paradigm onto the web so that we can easily share rich text between applications
    - see paper by Dan Chudnov et al - "Introducing the UnAPI"
- cards are the future of the web
- cards already adopted by major websites as their design pattern - works well on smart phones
- Chris Tse - Patterns of Card UI Design
    - the most important part of card design is movement - within narratives, messaging, workflows
    - card architecture - render like a page; react like an app; report using APIs; restore like a file
- there is decline of open web and rise of app walled garden
- cardstack.io - goal is to build card ecosystem based on open web technologies (HTML5 and various JS) 
- 7 on 7 conference - pair artist with technologist for one-day hackfest
    - worked on a platform where artists could sell their work and transfer its ownership - uses block chain technology
- library and bibliography are connected by the card


## Ryerson Library's Digital Media Experience Lab: Serendipity in the Digital Age

Fangmin Wang, Namir Ahmed, and Sally Wilson (Ryerson University)

### Fangmin

- couldn't ignore the rise of makerspaces in libraries 
- Fangmin took study leave to research the DME lab setup
- want students to be producers, not just consumers, of knowledge; need to be playful and willing to explore
- when you combine "mindspace" and "makerspace" it's very powerful
- also feeds into the Ryerson goal of entrepreneurship for students
- makerspace is more about people than technology and space

### Namir (director of DME)

- opened in Feburary 2015 - brought in lots of technology and encouraged people to try it out (e.g. 3-D printing, Occulus Rift) and got data from who came
- about 35% were engineering students, with 20% being business students - approximately reflects the general student population demographics
- trying to get the various disciplines to interact
    - incentivise - e.g. will provide student group with a product/technology, as long as the students then teach others
    - encourage open play and exploration - start with simple things and then build into something more complex (e.g. Little Bits)
    - display interesting projects - e.g. topographic sand table
- case studies i.e. how they use the space
    - student research - e.g. soft robotics
    - peer to peer learning 
    - student support - e.g. helping students with business ideas
    - student-led workshops  
    - integration with curriculum 
    - faculty workshops
    - community outreach - e.g. did a March break event for high school students and their parents


## The Lost World of Telidon: Challenges in the Conservation of Glenn Howarth's Art

John Durno (University of Victoria)

- project to restore the digital art created by Glenn Howarth
- Telidon - implementation of Videotex in Canada by CRC

- NAPLPS - ASCII-based encoding scheme for bandwidth-optimized images; used Microstar shareware to view the images
- cd.textfiles.com/simtelctc
- DOSBox - had to find a way to view the images with a slower machine because the graphics were supposed to incrementally build, but any modern computer was too fast
- also used Apple II emulator to view older floppy disks


## Virtual Collaboration: Tips and Tricks for Working Together at a Distance

Sarah Simpkin (University of Ottawa) and Sam Popowich (University of Alberta)

- Avdi Grimm - "Pair with Me" - learn Ruby with him
- setup
    - canarie.ca server, hosted by cybera.ca
    - ansible playbook to install OS and basic packaging
    - SSH keys
    - tmux (terminal multiplexer)
    - Google Hangout - for face-to-face chat and screen sharing
    - Slack
- did about four 1-hour sessions:
    - testing
    - refactoring
    - unix/infrastructure work
    - git/github practice
- ways to learn from each other
    - pair programming
    - hackfests
    - code reading groups - see Coral Sheldon Hess's talk at C4Lib 2015
    - birds of a feather - read code, analyze, and kick ideas around
    - reading the documentation/forums

### Q and A

- Q: institutional support?
- A: yes, could set own hours
- Q: did you look at online code editors e.g. Code::Blocks?
- A: not for this project, but if continue will investigate
