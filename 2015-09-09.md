## Public Computing and the Revolution

Opening Keynote & Dave Binkley Memorial Lecture

Molly Sauter (McGill University)

- @oddletters
- studies online disruptive activism
- author of "The coming swarm" book (re: DDOS attacks, etc.)
- privately-owned public space (POPS) 
    - e.g. Zuccotti Park in NY during Occupy Wall Street
    - e.g. Trump Tower in Manhattan 1st floor atrium
- developers receive benefits for operating POPS
- Internet is a POPS, but there aren't any public areas (i.e. owned by a public entity)
    - companies moderate the content on "their" servers, but users have assumption that the content they post will persist and the rights they have in private will carry over to the Web
    - e.g. Spotify TOS - have rights to your photos, access to address book, knowledge of whether phone is still/moving
- "click wrap agreements" - digital version of "shrink wrap agreement"
- discussion of liability waivers
- binding arbitration agreements (e.g. Spotify) - agree to not go to court, but instead use corporation-assigned arbitration
- terms of service - corporations want to have profit-maximizing users (automatons!)
- "safe harbour protections" - corporations remove content without thorough investigation because of threat from publishers, etc.
- monitoring of abusive behaviour is being outsourced by corporations (e.g. Facebook)
- existing laws support the private sector/corporations rather than rights of users
- distributed/crowd computing 
    - e.g. SETI@Home, Folding@Home
- still operate within the privately-owned public Internet (POPI)
- POPI is essentially a surveillance machine
- "we are constantly sending off a fume of data exhaust" - e.g. Google Maps knows where you've been with your phone
- corporations try to assign users to data profiles 
- one mode of resistance is obfuscation of data - e.g. browser plug-ins such as Track Me Not, Ad Noseum - add data "noise" to the data stream
- PGP encryption is another way to resist - the more people who use it, the less that data activists are outliers (i.e. cause for suspicion by authorities)
- Electronic Disturbance Theatre - etoy.com vs. etoys.com - DDOS attack during Christmas 1999
- DDOS is not really about turning off a site, but rather about getting press coverage
- DDOS allows activists to inhabit parallel space with targets of the attack - i.e. "you have to recognize our presence, rather than monetize our complicity"
- however, activists can also use force of crowds to shut down dissenting voices - e.g. DDOS attacks on private media outlets, because expensive to defnd against, and ISP won't host

### Q and A

- Q: nation-state responses ("astro-turfing") e.g. Russia sponsoring posts against Ukraine; Chinese 50-cent army
- A: cyberwar operates on a different level than digital activism; 2010-2012 DDOS were viewed as political; now more talk about DDOS as crime 
- Q: possible to do political activism outside of Facebook, Twitter, etc.?
- A: Facebook has network effect (it's where the people are); but is a problem because you are ironically buying into the structure
- Q: Tools that would be nice to have?
- A: EDT created FloodNet (for DDOS attacks); Anonymous's low/high orbit ion cannon, sends ping requests; some corporations use DDOS-mitigation services if they expect DDOS attacks


## AODA: Enabling Innovation

Randy Oldham and Adam Doan (University of Guelph)

- review of AODA - introduced June 2005+
- WCAG 2 - web content a11y guidelines, developed by W3C
- Jan 1, 2016 deadline
- legislation is vague; there are sweeping "outs" (e.g. when "not practicable"; third-party systems; archival and special collections resources)
    - contributes to non-compliance or avoidance
- web-based audio and video
    - must have caption and transcript
    - can upload to YouTube, get a starting point, and then edit the transcript; then paste the transcript as the description of the video in YouTube, so that it can be indexed
- websites must be keyboard-navigable
    - with screen readers, users get trapped in embedded items
    - work around is to take screen capture of the video, with play button visible, and then link out to the video on YouTube directly (ensure alt tag on image)
    - Note: YouTube videos are now embeddable; however, if they change their code in the future, then beholden to their solution. The solution mentioned above will still work.
- tables must present information relationships in a visual way
    - table summary not enough
    - accessible tables still nightmare for screen reader; therefore think of alternate formats
    - e.g. calendars - is case for content management and list views
- enabling transcription - i.e. non-text content requires text alternative
    - there is archival resource exemption; however, if don't provide text alternative then not full-text searchable
    - UofG project to scan hundreds of thousands of hand-written farm diaries; used Omeka plug-in to provide crowd-sourced transcriptions; if patron requires a transcription can create one
- be creative, read the documentation, and work with open source to leverage your resources
- roldham@uoguelph.ca for set of slides

### Q and A

- Q: Tools for WCAG validation?
- A: UofG uses SiteImprove (scans entire website and looks for compliance); WAVE; use as many tools as possible, and be familiar with the legislation
- Q: What about crowd-provided resources?
- A: e.g. DSpace, where students upload theses - have access to backend so try to make the UI accessible; can also try to educate the people providing the content (e.g. at registration with the site)


## Special Snowflakes: Applying New UX Tools to Library Systems

Shelley Gullikson (Carleton University), Susanna Galbraith (McMaster University), and Krista Godfrey (Memorial University)

- all did ethnographic research to design usability testing
- know your user and the context - are Carleton students actually different from Memorial students?
- we are not our patrons - need to understand the motivations of our students
- design and user experience often differ
- when doing usability testing, need to listen without preconceived notions in mind
- methods:
    - observation - activities, pathways, patrons, etc.
    - interviews - informal; let patron use own words
    - mapping - can map spaces and research process
    - letter writing - love and breakup letters - what they like or don't like, and why
- results at Memorial - mapping successful; letters not as useful, and hoping for more breakup letters
- results at McMaster - mapping by students of research process revealed they started in Google Scholar and then head to databases; none mentioned going to library and getting help; most students uncomfortable with love/breakup letters
- results at Carleton - students enjoyed the mapping exercises and the letter writing; students used Summon and one database and then move to Google Scholar -- they didn't go to another database
- things in common:
    - lack of help seeking by students - librarians not included in the research processes 
    - did usability testing after updating "help" to "can't find what you're looking for?", and pushing students to ask for help; but students still didn't click on the help
- big picture, there were clear similarities 
    - students ask for help from friends first
    - they stick with their "proven" or easy path - i.e. don't switch databases
    - go with what they trust (Google)

### Q and A

- Q: if doing ethnographic study again, would you focus on where they are getting help?
- A: yes
- Q: How to decide on specific approach(es)?  Did you consider pairing up with anthropology departments?
- A: Were trying to apply techniques learned at UXLibs conference (e.g. love/breakup letters and mapping). Wanted to test these things ourselves; however, if doing a large study would consider pairing with anthro department.
- Q: ethics review for this type of research?
- A: At McMaster did need ethics review and approval, because working with health sciences students. At Memorial didn't need an ethics review at all. At Carleton needed a protocol to ensure that students wouldn't feel judged on the quality of the writing of love letters.


## Ask What Digital Humanities Can Do for You

Lisa Goddard (University of Victoria)

- DH and libraries have overlapping needs/strengths/weaknesses:
    - DH researchers have 3-5 year funding cycles, but don't have steady funding for infrastructure; whereas libraries have more steady funding for basic infrastructure but not for digital collections development
    - libraries have a deep, permanent labour pool that can't be changed quickly; DH have a labour pool of students that change frequently
- possible ways DH and libraries can collaborate:
    - transcriptions and enhanced descriptions could be done by students
    - Digital humanists can help with the interpretations and XML mark-up of our digital collections
    - libraries still working on linked data, whereas DH's are doing lots of work in this area
    - DH is working on discovery environments 
    - collaborate interpretation - annotate the digital collections e.g. Infinite Ulysses
    - DH's can work as Open Access advocates
    - digital preservation is huge opportunity and concern for libraries and DH's
- UVic has a Grants Librarian (Christine Walde) - identifies funding sources and areas of collaboration
- conclusion: there is strategic alignment between digital humanities and libraries

## Changing the Way We Do Things

Peter Binkley, Tricia Jenkins, Kenton Good (University of Alberta), and Alan Harnum (OCAD University, formerly Toronto Public Library)

### UAlberta 

- lots of "new" at UA: UL, AUL, leadership team at UA, new provincial government
- old practices - lone wolves; project silos; little communication among library systems people; incosistent practices; open source but not really; single points of failure (or success)
- 2014+ - open data, open code, open content 
- library guiding principles = responsive, open, sustainable
    - open - github.com/ualbertalib; open source solutions; CC licensing of web content; free OJS hosting
    - responsive - increased size of team; adoption of agile/scrum; improved server practice (Configuration management; continuous integration); inter-team cooperation
    - sustainable - community solutions vs. lone wolf (e.g. Hydra, Fedora, etc.); digital asset management (DAM) strategy; investment in people (focused staffing hires); large dedicated training budget
- working method - scrum (because Hydra community worked this way); implemented in github; operating in public
- scrum - user stories to describe the work; product backlog; 2 week sprints; daily standups (this has been the biggest help; improved communication); spring kick-off and retrospective
- no code gets into master without a pull request (i.e. second pair of eyes on the code)
- estimation is one of the most difficult aspects of the sprint planning
- using vagrant to ensure repeatability - can take "golden image" and customize development environment
- also using ansible for provisioning production environments
- take 1 hour on Friday to discuss items, and place in developer handbook on github - great for new developers and onboarding
- these items (i.e. agile/scrum/sprint) mostly in use with Hydra Project - will this scale to all the other projects?
- there were growing pains with configuration management and estimation
- balancing the old and new is a challenge


### Alan Harnum (TPL)

- was part of e-services team, which is not information technology team
- defined cloud as "buying computing on demand"
- wanted to buy servers when needed, and use desired tools/languages
- culture toolstack - risk tolerance; management backing; frustration with status quo
- tech toolstack - DigitalOcean for on-demand infrastructure; ansible for automation; Ruby for fast product development
- deliverables
    - Toronto Poetry Map (torontopoetry.ca) - Ruby on Rails, Leaflet, Mapbox; built in 6 weeks; still being updated
    - Overdrive Holds and Copies Service - microservice architecture in Ruby/Sinatra; delivers real-time holds and copies for Overdrive e-books using their API; serves ~16K requests/day on 20% capacity of $10/month instance; done in about 10 days
    - microsites - cloud deployment to nginx server
- lessons and caveats
    - didn't have privacy issues in the cloud applications
    - culture matters and so do tools
    - it is surprisingly cheap to do this
    - "work smarter, not harder" can actually be true
- "tech history doesn't repeat, but it does rhyme" - e.g. electrification (buy off the grid)
- separation of value from hype is key technology skill
- our funders may require us to move in this direction regardless of our desires
- recommended reading
    - The practice of cloud system administration
    - The phoenix project

### Q and A and comments 

- Q: Does rest of UA library know about new approach?
- A: Scrum model requires stakeholders and have pulled new people into Hydra Project. Have presented at library council and fielded some questions about how it could be used for non-technology projects.

- Comment: AWS is cheaper than DigitalOcean for large projects (multi-terabytes); Digital Ocean is good for spinning up test sites and for smaller sites

- Q: cloud infrastructure takes more work than anticipated
- A: Does require some sense of total cost of ownership; it's going to cost someone to administer it


## DIS-INTE-GRATE!

Thomas Guignard (Ontario Colleges Library Service)

- hilarious (because the truth is funnier than fiction) monologue in style of Welcome to Night Vale podcast
- OPAC vs. discovery layer
- OPAC's acquisition module duplicated by institution's accounting department 
- OPAC's serials module also duplicated in holdings records
- keep OPAC just for circulation module - but have to create pipeline for institution authentication
- Slides: http://www.slideshare.net/thomasguignard/disintegrate
- Transcript: http://bit.ly/accessdaleks
- GF: this was my favourite presentation of Access (and I believe for many others too)!


## Maker Culture on the Go: Portable Maker Kits at Vaughan Public Libraries

Alison Neal and Dina Stevens (Vaughan Public Library)

- concept - inspired by concept taken from PLA 2014 presentation; proposal to management with budget and implementation; setup in any space, non-permanent; kits are rotated through branches every 3 months
- development - www.vaughanpl.info/services/maker_kit shows contents of kit; had to consider cost and ease of use; did lots of comparison shopping before purchasing; about $13K for first 6 kits; added 2 more kits due to popularity and desire to have kit at each branch
- implementation - chose kit experts; all-staff training; brainstorming and program creation; lots of pratice before running programs; had kits out for exploration by public, but also had by-appointment and scheduled programming 
- results - 2402 people attended programs since December 2014; provided budget for kit expansion; increased availability; excited staff members and happy customers
- challenges - staff willingness and expertise; timid customers; budget restrictions

### Q and A

- Q: uptake by adults?
- A: 3-D printing popular with older teens and adults; MindStorms popular with tweens; older adults enjoy the graphic design kit


## Contest of Champions: Headless Battle!

Daniel Sifton (Vancouver Island University)

- based on work of Kristina Spurgin's E-Book Access Checker (http://journal.code4lib.org/articles/9684)
- JRuby/Celerity
    - celerity is no longer maintained; error handling difficult
- Ruby/Capybara/Poltergeist
    - PhantomJS; error handling is verbose; all command line, but can invoke head at will
- Ruby/Watir
    - slow; OK error handling; can invoke head at will
- Python/BS4
    - champion
- future - journals
- github.com/telezoic/headless-battle


## Ensmartening the Web

Michel Castagné (University of Ottawa)

- discussion of smartwatches
- disembodied personal assistants
- design principles:
    - launch automatically - e.g. when walking by library, remind about overdue books
    - glanceable
    - leverage "suggest" and "demand"
    - zero or low interaction


## In Our Own Words: Libraries, Makerspaces and Community Engagement

Lydia Zvyagintseva (University of Toronto Scarborough)

- founder of Open Edmonton - vision is to improve civic life through improvement of open data
- it all started with recording studios in Edmonton Public Libraries
- civic engagement - did oral histories ("In Your Own Words" project) at the EPL recording studios; did project for 8 weeks; placed oral histories on SoundCloud
- did some geomapping of the histories and then did a metadatathon 
- next steps - collection building; preservation; use and reuse
- what you need
    - community
    - recording equipment
    - plan (ethics, metadata)
    - promotion and outreach
    - platform
- @openedmonton


## Héritage: Metadata Challenges and Opportunities

Julienne Pascoe (Canadiana)

- canadiana.ca - CRL trust-worthy digital repository; 2nd after ScholarsPortal
- Héitage - 60 million pages of documents
- metadata challenges - archival material, much of it hand-written; need to do collection-level analysis for determining what metadata to create
- metadata opportunities
   - crowdsourcing for metadata generation - builds community while generating metadata; however, some challenges with metadata quality; therefore partner with special groups that have interest in the various collections; triage projects based on popularity
   - also looking at outsourcing transcriptions of structured data
   - linked open data - break down items into data statements - "Out of the Trenches" is pilot project
- Canadiana has linked data roadmap
- Comment that Portland Common Data Model (PCDM) is popular with Hydra/Islandora community and may be useful for Canadiana's project


## Linked Open Data: the Value-Add to a Postcard Collection

Robert Warren (Carleton University) and Sharon Farnel (University of Alberta)

- UA had set of digitized postcards (Peel Prairie Postcards Collection)
- had rich set of metadata available in the collection
- were looking to document process and try to offload to machines/automation
- started with MODS then used LC stylesheet to convert to RDF
- experimented with facial detection 
- converting from authority-controlled strings to URIs
- extract business and personal names using FOAF
- linked open data allows you to recover from bad data - e.g. "<city>Regina?</city>" entered in metadata - don't know if Regina or not, but know it's at least in Saskatchewan
- geonames database is growing - can link to the ever-expanding work
- can also link to LoC information rather than having the metadata in own system
- can make inferences about group membership, dates of birth/death because of person's presence in a picture
- currently have database with interface for users; sometimes users need to talk to partner interface to expand search of database, or even talk to database directly 
- finding information is easy; finding information that you need is hard
- "The thing and the name of the thing aren't the same thing"
- with linked open data, don't need to care about vocabularies - just need to be able to describe your own data
- lessons learned and next steps
    - the artifact might be less important than the (meta)data
    - Excel is the enemy of data quality
    - separate the data from the application
    - RDF/LOD allows you to publish data, document it and (sometimes) fix mistakes later on
- https://github.com/muninn/PC-Access2015
- comment that PCDM is creating some core ontologies that can be shared across all data and still allow collections to have uniqueness
