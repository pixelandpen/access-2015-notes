## Navigating Linked Open Data: a Panel Discussion

Christina Harlow (University of Tennessee), Tim Knight (Osgoode Hall Law School Library at York University), and Sarah Sutherland (CanLII)

### Tim - KF Modified (classificiation scheme for law libraries) linked data project

- LoC didn't have Canadian law library classification until the 1970s
- LCC classed law books by jurisdiction which means books on criminal law scattered throughout collection
- KF Modified classified first by subject, then by jurisdiction
- first developed an XML schema appropriate for KF modified - for concepts and classifications
- then converted print KF Modified to XML - couldn't rely fully on regex and had to manually create some of the XML, using macros to help speed things up
- mapped XML elements to SKOS - Simple Knowledge Organization System (http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/)
- then worked on creating XSLT to convert HTML to RDF
- tested sample MARC record set against conversion process
    
### Christina - Smokies Authorities

- http://bit.ly/dots_start
- had local vocabulary for Great Smoky Mountains Regional Collection
- Database of the Smokies (DOTS) - http://dots.lib.utk.edu
    - implemented as Drupal module with loosely applied vocabulary
    - no identifiers
    - hierarchical structure that was not machine-parseable
    - DOTS terms loosely mirror LOC authorities - makes for inconsistent facets
- goal was to formalize the hierarchy and vocabulary to make it machine-readable
- also wanted content specialists to add information about DOTS term
- also wanted to extend existing external datasets e.g. Geonames, LOC
- goal is build taxonomy to LOD vocabulary
- goal is find ways to pull updates from LOC terms
- LODRefine = Linked Open Data Refine software
- created DOTS SKOS RDF N-Triples
- then loaded SKOS RDF N-triples into Jena Fuseki (SPARQL server) and Skosmos
- particular problem: Cherokee villages don't have LOC classifications, so have to rely on information for current village 

### Q and A

- Q: suitability of library classification schemes and/or controlled vocabs for semantic web and related applications?
- A: The classifications were implemented for printed books; therefore there are distinct limitations if used for semantic web.  The classification systems are not full ontologies. 
- Q: both projects are in the hinterland, not served by the metropolis. If in metropolis, would it be different?
- A: Big, legacy platforms have difficulties too; DOTS was small and manageable and helped expose problems with the metropolis. Not everything is hinterland, but everything is data silo. Goal is that our projects in the hinterland can interact with the metropolis. 
- Q: Aaron Kuperman quote - cataloguers are changing from just cataloguing books to providing metadata for resources accessed online.
- A: Agree that we need to think more about metadata than about creating bibliographic records. When creating data policies try to have holistic view - i.e. think about how the data from the various systems (ILS, IR, etc.) can/should interact
- Q: What infrastructure and tools do libraries need for LD work?
- A: Would be nice to have linked data machine i.e. something like Archivematica where you ingest bib records and it spits out LD. MARCEdit is very helpful tool. If can expose the data as SPARQL endpoints then there are many other tools that can convert data to appropriate format. Cataloguing processes are also important - "tinkering" is key part of this workflow change/improvement.
- Q: [comment] organizations put most resources into building ILS, rather than tinkering with LOD. Vendors promise LD tools but they don't materialize.
- A: Have tried to work with cataloguers with MARC expertise, and then apply that expertise to LD. UTK moved to Alma, but are moving some data from Alma to open source applications - because want access to the raw data.
- Q: roadblocks?
- A: The sheer amount of time and work required for data munging. Data modeling is also very complicated work.  Need a lot of developer chops to get these projects off the ground; takes time to learn new things. Don't even know what questions to ask sometimes, leads to communications issues. 


## Doing More with 3D Printing

Dale Askey (McMaster University)

- got into it in 2014 based on needs of grad students' in Sherman Centre
- then launched public printing service in Lyons New Media Centre - have 2 printers now due to backlog of requests
- things we learned:
    - reliable printing is still a pipe dream
    - MakerBot was complete and utter disaster (which ultimately led to deep learning about 3D printing so there were benefits)
- two major, vexing flaws
    - chronic underextrusion (i.e. not enough plastic is used) - discovered that hot-end issues play a role, but friction is the major culprit; changed some of the design of printers to reduce the friction in the feeding of the filaments
    - build plate adhesion - ended up using fingernail polish remover and a bit of ABS filament
- future plans
    - experimentation - new types of filaments; acetone vapour baths
    - design - produce designs; 3D scanning; custom modifications
    - teaching - printer certification course, and also intro to 3D printing workshops
    - sharing - product reviews; testing results; videos of repairs and tuning steps
- why do all this?
    - practical fabrication needs - e.g. Raspberry Pi cases; custom hard drive chassis
    - research fabrication - customized items for grad students
    - do the hard work so that users can work on the creative process
    - fostering experimentation

## The Future of Access

- next year at University of New Brunswick Libraries
- has to be organized and paid for through a university due to its structure
- discussion about how to make Access sustainable (especially the finance side) 
- small working group will come with proposal at AccessYFC 2016


## OA or GTFO -- Closing Keynote

Amy Buckland

- is third generation in newspaper business - therefore challenging concepts important
- libraries are not neutral 
- tenure construct - rules that discourage creativity and change
- need more transparency in publishing industry
- compliant != accessible
- scholarly commons is no longer publicly available due to paywalls ("privately owned public spaces")
- we are saying who belongs in higher education if we have paywalls and only people in certain locations with certain privilege have access
- classification schemes do not reflect reality 
- citizen scientists need access to resources which traditionally have gone to research institutions
- need to connect and overcome our information silos - i.e. don't bother creating digital collections if they are encumbered with copyright restrictions
- it's not about the tools - need to focus on the users and their needs
- we need to insert ourselves into scholarly work (anything that encourages creation and propagation of knowledge)
- we are part of a generative process 
- the library can help people make sense of the world
- community is key 
- need to talk about OA as normal 
- open access means open for all - need to recognize our privilege 
- it is up to us to fix this 

### Q and A

- Q: How to convince professors that tenure is (part of) the problem?
- A: Need to debunk myths about open access journals and quality, and data around increased traffic to OA journals. Some institutions are writing OA into the tenure requirements. 
- Q: How to shut down voices in library community that promote themselves as OA experts, and create blacklists of journals?
- A: Smack downs are coming. Like everything, need to critique any 'lists', and teach people to think for themselves.
